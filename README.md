### Hi, I'm Polijan ðŸ‘‹

* I love computers and tinkering with them. Naturally, I like Linux and C and the terminal, stuff like Raspberry Pi, and old machines like 8-bit computers which gave you the ability to peek/poke where you want. Software wants to be free.

* Away from computers, I am a juggler, a tokiponist, and I enjoy being outdoors or stargazing.
